	( arcerusplayer11, 8th February, 2021 )

Alpha 6
Minor type fix.
Updated meta time
Added timezone to meta file.
A 'What was I thinking?!' update to Metadata.print().
Fixed typo in ghost3::Metadata.print()
dded Metadata struct, and we print Metadata one time on init based
	on a flag in the GHOST combo.
Added a ghost3.zcombo file to the package, with normal settings enabled.
Added file daira.zs, fixing the bugs in the Daira NPC used by classic.zh.
Moved demo scripts that had KW 'using' into ghost3 namespace due to numerous
	erros: See 'header/ghost_zh/3.0/demo/demo-errors-with-using-kw.txt'.
Corrected default behaviour of GNV_FAKE_EWEAPON_Z flag.
Rebuilt quest file with all current files in latest 2.55A89P,
	and tested it: All seems good, new demo is at:
	'/header/ghost_zh/3.0/demo/ghost_zh_demo_3.0-Alpha-6.qst'
	Let's figure out why I am having these build errors if scripts have the
	'using' keyword...
	( ZoriaRPG, 7th February, 2021 )
	
Fixed flags, added Wizzrobe movement.
	( arcerusplayer11, 7th February, 2021 )

Add recompiled demo for Alpha 5 made in 2.55A89P
Re-organised the main header file, for readability.
Move generic enum for data[] flags into enum DataRegisters.
Added enum for data array registers, and sized arrays to [DATA_SIZE]
Minor optimisation.

	( ZoriaRPG, 4th February, 2021 )
	
Alpha 4
Added Dataweapons; weapons that store data.
	Weapons should no longer use an excessive amount of Misc variables because of this.
	GetEWeaponAttribute and SetEWeaponAttribute have been added; use these to access internal variables.
	Added Grow and Shrink lifespans; weapons will scale up or down over time.
	( arcerusplayer11, 4th February, 2021 )
	
Alpha 3
Fixed improper merge.
Merge remote-tracking branch 'ghostv3/3.0.0-Alpha-3' into 3.0.0-Alpha-3 
Added WallBounce weapon movement.
	( arcerusplayer11, 4th February, 2021 )
	
Fix mixup with GetCombo not returning combodata.
Converted the remaining settings to use combo labels on init.
Added init routines that use Game->Ghost[] to cache values.
	This replaces using header-defined constants, in favour of
	TILESET-based settings using three combos.
	These values are populated the first time that a ghost script
	runs by calling ghost3::init(). Every script should call this,
	and if it has already run, it prompty returns.
	This should be relatively fast, but not as fast as compile-time
	constants; however the benefit of tileset-based implementation
	AND the ability of individual scripts to CHANGE settings at
	any time, is. IMO, worth the minor extra weight.
	( ZoriaRPG, 4th February, 2021 )

Alpha 2
Example framing for weapon death events.
Added GetInvisibleCombo()
Remove GhostIsPit(), not needed. Refactor OnSidePlatform().

Initial commit, version 3.0 (rewrite) for 2.55
	( arcerusplayer11, ZoriaRPG[merged] 30th January, 2021 )
	This removed useless code and was the initial phase of the rewrite.
	e.g., AutoGhost and global active scripts are no longer used.
	Everything now relies on noc scripts, and weapon scripts.
